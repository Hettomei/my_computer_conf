;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

;; "Prefix argument" is SPC u in doom
;; example, in normal mode :
;; press g a -> display info.
;; press SPC u g a -> display extended info.
;;
;; Please do not add variable using easy custom. Or it will be hard to save configuration.

;; flexible, simple tools for minibuffer completion in Emacs : https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper
;; Ivy, a generic completion mechanism for Emacs.
;; Counsel, a collection of Ivy-enhanced versions of common Emacs commands.
;; Swiper, an Ivy-enhanced alternative to isearch.
;;
;; Counsel has a lot of function with projectile; M-x counsel to see list.
;; Sometimes, I may prefer use simple counsel-* over counsel-projectile-*

;; To get unicode char like λ 👍 🍺 ⚠
;; run M-x counsel-unicode-char

;; reload a file by reading hard drive :

;; SPC TAB -> workspace
;; Kill a project/workspace -> SPC TAB d
;; One of my problem was having a workspace at /hub-ecla
;; and another at /hub-ecla/admin
;; projectile does not allow this. Workspace allow it.
;; To do it :
;; SPC TAB n
;; Then swhitch using gt (change tab)
